# DealSeal

Only 0.47% of issued coupons are ever redeemed. This means that most people are not aware of the coupons that are available for redemption at the moment. Let's say you are in the NYU area and you are looking for a place to grab coffee. You get another cup of $7 coffee from Think while there is a deal to get coffee for $2 from the Irving Farm that's around the corner.

**DealSeal** is a solution: find active deal in real time near you and avoid unnecessary expenses!
